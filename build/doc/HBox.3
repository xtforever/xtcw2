.SH NAME
HBox
.SH DESCRIPTION
This widget puts the child widgets from left to right in a box.
  each widget is assigned the same size.
  When a child widget is created the function change_manged is called by Xt.
  change_managed() calls calculate_size() to determine its size.
  then change_managed() calls XtMakeGeometryRequest() to tell its parent
  that this widget wants another size. the parent shall resize this widget.
  after that all childs are resized.
  XtMakeGeometryRequest() leads to call of geometry_manager() of the parent
  widget. The parent widgets decides what to do. hopefully the parent will
  accept the given size and will resize itself and its child.
  calculate_size() calls XtQueryGeometry() on every child.
  This leads to a call to the query_geometry() method of the child.
  The child widget will respond with its size.
