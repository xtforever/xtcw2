struct nbus_ctx :     keeps track of connected clients
struct nbus_client:   client status


server

  int h = nbus_create( "socket" )
  - open tcp listen socket, create struct nbus_ctx and return handle
    to this struct
    

  nbus_poll_event(h)
  - call i_server_select( h, timeout) to poll events from server socket
  - wait max 300ms for event then return 0
  - if data arrived put data in client incomming queue (nbus_client.q)
  - use extract_mgs to copy bytes from incomming queue to
    message buffer (nbus_client.msg) (but only if buffer is incomplete)
  - if newline is received return CLIENT_REQ
    client id is stored in struct nbus_ctx.msg_from_id
    message is stored in struct nbus_client.msg
    
  - if the connection broke return CLIENT_EXIT
  
  
  
  nbus_msg(h)
  - get message from last client connection
  - use poll_msg(struct nbus_client*) to extract and free message from client
